# Community Eyes

A [Shinigami Eyes](https://github.com/shinigami-eyes/shinigami-eyes) fork
designed to fix a number of underlying, fundamental issues with it's design
philosophy:

* Shinigami Eyes provides no opt-out option for it's pro-trans highlight. Critics have pointed out repeatedly that this could easily out people to
abusers or oppressive governments, as well as giving transphobes an easy list
of targets to harass. One goal of this fork is to create an opt-in system
for the green highlight, in order to prevent such a situation from occuring
nonconsentually.
* Shinigami Eyes operates under a BDFL (**B**enevolent **D**ictator **F**or
**L**ife) development model. What this means is that the original author is 
the only one who controls commits to the main repo, and is the only person who
can add or remove names from either highlight list. This has serious
implications regarding the possibility for the author to abuse their power
in deciding who is added to which list, and there have been documented
instances where this has occured, and trans people have been added to
the red list over petty, intra-community discourse. If this fork attracts
enough attention, the author of this fork fully intents to form a community
committee to oversee the managing of the lists, to help insure against such
abuse. Such a committee does not exist at the moment, because we do not want
it to simply become a clique of people we personally like, and we intend to
eventually recruit people who we don't personally know, but who are invested
in the project (frequent contributors, people who raise good issues, etc.).
* Shinigami Eyes only supports a small number of corporate social media sites.
This fork intends to eventually add support for flagging these names in
federated protocols (various ActivityPub implementations [e.g. mastodon, 
pleroma], common email providers, etc.), potentially marking known nasty
domains (such as fediverse instances known to harbor bad actors), and possibly
even devise a way of marking flagged users procedurally in unknown contexts
and sites.
* Shinigami Eyes currently only flags for cissexism, a very narrow kind of
bigotry. This project aims to expand the scope of reasons for flagging, to
include as many axes of collective liberation as we can. This will hopefully
include flags for antiblackness, white supremacy, ableism, transmisogyny,
neurotypical supremacy, pedophilia, and just general capitalist bootlicking.

Note that this fork is still a work in progress, and none of these features
are implemented yet. Please be patient, as my system is the only contributor at the moment.
